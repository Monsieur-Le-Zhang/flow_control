it is a 1986 horror novel by American author Stephen King. The story follows the exploits of seven children as they are terrorized
by the eponymous being, which exploits the fears and phobias of its victims in order to disguise itself while hunting its prey.
"It" primarily appears in the form of a clown in order to attract its preferred prey of young children. The novel is told through
narratives alternating between two time periods, and is largely told in the third-person omniscient mode. It deals with themes that
eventually became King staples: the power of memory; childhood trauma; the ugliness lurking behind a fa√ßade of traditional small-town
values. The novel won the British Fantasy Award in 1987, and received nominations for the Locus and World Fantasy Awards that same year.
